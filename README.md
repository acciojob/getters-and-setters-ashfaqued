# Getters and Setters

Create a class called `Person` that has a constructor method that takes two arguments: `name` and `age`. It should have a getter for name and a setter for age. Then, create a subclass called `Student` that extends the Person class. Add a method to the Student class called `study()` that logs `<name> is studying` to the console. Also, create a subclass called `Teacher` that extends the Person class. Add a method to the Teacher class called `teach()` that logs `<name> is teaching` to the console.
